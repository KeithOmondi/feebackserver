    description: "Background and context of the Manual.",
    content: "The Judicial Service Commission (the Commission) is constitutionally mandated to exercise disciplinary control over judicial officers and staff of the Judiciary in accordance with Articles 171 and 172 of the Constitution of Kenya. To facilitate this mandate, Parliament enacted the Judicial Service Act, 2011, establishing clear procedures for handling disciplinary matters within the Judicial Service. Since then, constitutional developments, judicial pronouncements on fair administrative action, and the enactment of laws such as the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015, have necessitated the development and formal codification of a dedicated Disciplinary Manual. This Manual provides clear guidance, harmonizes procedures, and strengthens accountability within the Judiciary. This enactment provides a codified framework for disciplinary processes, ensuring consistency, clarity, and compliance with the Constitution, the Judicial Service Act, and other relevant statutes."

    title: "GUIDING PRINCIPLES",
    part: "PART TWO",
    description: "Principles governing disciplinary control in the judicial service.",
    content: "Disciplinary control in the judicial service is governed by the following principles: (a) The rules of natural justice which include: (i) Procedural fairness, where an officer must be allowed adequate opportunity to prepare and present his/her case; (ii) Impartiality of the deciding authority when hearing and making decisions; and (iii) Decisions which are based on logical proof or evidential material. (b) Fair administrative action which is expeditious, efficient, lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair. Every officer to whom disciplinary action is taken has a right to: (i) Written reasons for any disciplinary action that is taken against him/her. (ii) Prior and adequate notice of the nature and reasons for the intended disciplinary action. (iii) An opportunity to be heard and to make representations in that regard. (iv) An opportunity to attend proceedings in person or in the company of an expert of his/her choice, cross examine persons who give adverse evidence against him/her and request for adjournment of proceedings where necessary. (v) Notice of a right to an appeal or review against a disciplinary decision. (vi) Information, materials and evidence to be relied upon in making a decision or taking a disciplinary action. (vii) Thorough investigation on the alleged misconduct shall be undertaken before any disciplinary action is taken. (viii) Application of other interventions and in resolving discipline cases such as training, guidance, peer review and counseling. (ix) Prompt implementation of decisions. (x) Right of appeal and application for review of disciplinary related decisions. (xi) Clarity on whether the administrative action is of an investigatory or disciplinary nature. Should an investigatory process turn into a disciplinary one, an employee must be accorded a fresh notice to prepare his/her defense."

    title: "ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTIONS",
    part: "PART TWO",
    description: "Non-punitive approaches to addressing misconduct.",
    content: "Psycho-social challenges may impact negatively on an officer's overall work performance, resulting to cases of indiscipline. As such, alternative interventions may be undertaken by the employer to address employee misconduct in place of traditional punitive disciplinary action. This may, under the right circumstances, be a more efficient and effective approach than traditional discipline. While alternative intervention requires more thoughtful decision-making and thus poses a greater challenge for supervisors than traditional discipline; the results can be worth the time and effort. Alternative intervention may result in modified behavior if used early in the disciplinary process for minor offences, but may not be effective in serious issues or habitual misconduct. The appropriateness of a certain approach will vary, based on the nature of the misconduct and personality of the individual whose conduct needs correcting. Alternative discipline interventions in the judicial service may take various forms such as training, workplace guidance and counseling."

    title: "WORKPLACE GUIDANCE AND COUNSELLING",
    part: "PART TWO",
    description: "Counselling as a first-line intervention.",
    content: "Some issues which manifest as indiscipline could be a result of psycho-social challenges an employee may be undergoing. It could also be due to lack of clarity of the assignment or the rules and regulations. Understanding the root cause of the problem will ensure application of the correct remedy. Punishing such an employee will not improve the situation but may aggravate it. Where it is established that the cause of indiscipline is psycho-social related, public institutions are encouraged to adopt workplace guidance and counselling as a first option. To address the challenge of lack of clarity, the supervisor has the responsibility to hold regular meetings with employees to clarify assignments and explain workplace rules. With regard to psycho-social challenges, work place counselling will be adopted; the main objective being to bring about a voluntary change in the employee, and help the employee overcome immediate problems and cope with future challenges. Counseling intervention is not a disciplinary action, as its purpose is not to create a negative experience, but rather to communicate helpful information and provide necessary support in management of psycho-social challenges. Counselling shall ordinarily be conducted by the Judiciary Psycho-social Support Unit as guided by the Judiciary Human Resources policies and procedures manual, 2025. Where preliminary investigations establish that an officer is experiencing psycho-social challenges: (a) Physcho-Social Support Unit shall recommend to the Chief Justice that the officer undergoes counselling. (b) The Chief Registrar (CRJ) shall inform the affected officer of the recommendation to refer him/her for counselling. (c) Upon consent by the affected officer, the CRJ shall make arrangement for the officer to undergo counseling. (d) Where the counsellor recommends for an officer to undergo rehabilitation, the CRJ shall refer the officer to a recognized rehabilitation Centre. (e) Where an officer declines to undergo counselling or rehabilitation, then the normal disciplinary process shall be initiated.."

    content: "Persistent under-achievement of performance targets by an employee can be a ground for dismissal. Sometimes an employee may not meet the set targets despite having put his best efforts. Before severe punishment of dismissal for under performance is taken, and if the officer is not guilty of any other misconduct, should first train the officer with the objective of improving performance. Supervisors are responsible for identifying individual officers' training needs which will lead to improved performance and productivity. The training intervention may include; induction, coaching, mentoring, role play or job rotation.."
