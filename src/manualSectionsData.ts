    title: "INTRODUCTION",
    part: "PART ONE: BACKGROUND",
    description: "Overview of the manual's purpose and authority.",
    content: "The Judicial Service Commission (the Commission) is constitutionally mandated to exercise disciplinary control over judicial officers and staff of the Judiciary in accordance with Articles 171 and 172 of the Constitution of Kenya. To facilitate this mandate, Parliament enacted the Judicial Service Act, 2011, establishing clear procedures for handling disciplinary matters within the Judicial Service. Since then, constitutional developments, judicial pronouncements on fair administrative action, and the enactment of laws such as the Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015, have necessitated the development and formal codification of a dedicated Disciplinary Manual. This Manual provides clear guidance, harmonizes procedures, and strengthens accountability within the Judiciary. This enactment provides a codified framework for disciplinary processes, ensuring consistency, clarity, and compliance with the Constitution, the Judicial Service Act, and other relevant statutes."
